    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Whether you are getting ready for Super Bowl Sunday or a group of hungry diners, these meatball snacks are irresistible (and customizable). We couldn't think of a better app to serve on game day.</p> <p>Creator Nicole McLaughlin describes these as "bite-sized Italian meatball sandwiches" and adds that they are "quick to prepare with frozen meatballs and refrigerated pizza dough."</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (13.8 ounce) cans refrigerated pizza dough</li>
        <li>24 frozen party-size meatballs, thawed slightly</li>
        <li>2/3 cup marinara sauce, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>additional optional seasonings include crushed red pepper flakes, Italian Seasoning, and garlic powder or minced garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a mini muffin tin with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Roll one can of dough out on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle slightly larger than the muffin tin and place the dough on top of the muffin tin. Lightly press dough into each muffin cup.  (Alternatively, place a second mini muffin pan on top of dough to easily press dough into each cup.)</li>
        <li>Place a meatball into each muffin cup and top evenly with sauce and mozzarella cheese. </li>
        <li>Roll remaining dough into a similar rectangle and place it on top. Press dough to seal each section, then use a knife to cut dough around each cup, forming 24 individual meatball sliders.  </li>
        <li>For each filled muffin cup, bring top corner of dough to meet bottom corner on the opposite side; repeat with the other side. Twist dough together lightly on top; pinch to seal. Repeat with all sections. </li>
        <li>Place oil in a small bowl and season with optional seasonings if desired. Brush oil over each meatball slider and sprinkle evenly with grated Parmesan cheese. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and toasted, 22 to 24 minutes.  Serve with extra marinara for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
